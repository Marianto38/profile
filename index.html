        <h2>Being a mom ü§±</h2>
          <P> I enjoy to spendtime in family, having my son and being able to
            enjoy each stage of his growth is wonderful, I always want to make
            him happy and give him maximum quality time, and excellent training.
            That is why I want to create an app to connect significant
            experiences in which to make the
            most of my family time.

          <h2>Loving crochet üß∂</h2>
            <P> More than spending time, it is a therapy, it allows me to connect
              with myself, develop creativity, set goals and feel pleased to see
              the results in the finished product, especially when I can give someone
              a piece that has taken me hours to make. weaving inspires and allows
              many feelings to be expressed in just each fabric.
